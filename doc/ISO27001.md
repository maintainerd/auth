---

## 8Ô∏è‚É£ **A.12 ‚Äî Operations Security**

* [ ] Log all authentication activities (login, token issuance).
* [ ] Implement error handling without leaking sensitive information.
* [ ] Apply security patches regularly.
* [ ] Monitor for dependency vulnerabilities (e.g., `govulncheck`).
* [ ] Define and enforce a secure CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions with security checks).
* [ ] Secure the build artifacts (signed binaries, checksums).

---

## 9Ô∏è‚É£ **A.13 ‚Äî Communications Security**

* [ ] Use HTTPS/TLS for all API communication.
* [ ] Secure inter-service communication (e.g., mTLS).

* [ ] Validate all incoming requests (e.g., input validation & JSON schema checks).

---

## üîü **A.14 ‚Äî System Acquisition, Development & Maintenance**

* [ ] Follow secure coding standards (e.g., OWASP ASVS).
* [ ] Perform code reviews with security focus.
* [ ] Provide clear documentation of API contracts.
* [ ] Maintain up-to-date dependency management.
